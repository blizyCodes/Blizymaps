# Blizymaps

A tiny Python project made using [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). 

## Features
A user can: 
* View Volcanoes in the US and their elevation. 
* View Population in countries.

The map has 2 layers and the user must select which one they wish to interact with. 
A country is **GREEN** if their population is less than 10mil, **ORANGE** if between 10mil and 20mil and **RED** if above 20mil. 

The project was created as my first practice app while learning Python and its functionalities are limited for the time being.
